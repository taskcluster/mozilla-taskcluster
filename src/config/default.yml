    Pushlog Commit Events
  description: |
    The pushlog events can be used to hook various other components into
    the act of commiting to a particuar repository (usually to kick off tests)
    this exchange is hopefuly a short lived thing which abstracts polling the
    pushlog for new data.

    Pushes will be monitored (via polling) and events will be sent as new data
    is available. If for some reason the service goes down previous commits
    will also be fetched and any missing data (up to a particular amount) will
    be sent as events...

# Nobody's quite sure why this is called try.  Don't be confused!  It includes all
# projects, not just try.

  # This is the preferred location for the decision task file for every repository.
  # Mustache parameters used to customize the path:

  #   - alias: current key name

  #   - path: sub path to repository
  #   - host: host of repository

  # If for some reason the task yaml is invalid we still would like to create a
  # task if for no other reason than to notify the user that this failed.  Note that this
  # is a YAML string embedded in YAML.
